These can be things like registered classes, graduation year, enrollment status, etc. Anything you can think of! Class flexibility is designed so that your approach reflects your own personal understanding of the problem. But for a more structured challenge read on...\n",

    "Class is where your own ideas get to come through as a programmer and designer. So there is no one right way to any of these. Give it your best shot and also be creative!\n",

    "Create a Class wide count of students that tracks how many students have been created. Then, usi that attriute to give every student a unique ID.\n",

    "Implement the method and the appropriate attributes that allows a student to print a statement about themselves. These can be as simple as \"say my own name\" or something like printing the student's favorite faculty member\n",

    "#### Challenge #3 create a subclass called Graduate Student\n",
    "The Graduate student should inherit from the base Student class. How do you think Graduate Students should be differentiated from the base Student? Add your own attribute or methods that you think they should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge #4 Create a School Class that has Students as attributes\n",
    "This is a separate class that is called School that can enroll Students, and graduate students. Maybe it can track its own endowment. This would be a large class that is meant to process these students in some way. \n"
